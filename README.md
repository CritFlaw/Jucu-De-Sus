Inspired by my grandparents' beautiful rural village in Romania, this website is a landing page for one of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) exercises to do with CSS. It mostly follows the project guidelines but uses a different color palette and a generated logo. I didn't go as fancy as some of the other examples but I am proud of my understanding of Flexbos and solving the various issues I came across with the layout. 

The CSS has a lot of comments in parts and none in others and it's not optimized at the moment but I wanted to get this up and potentially improve on it with time, just to get comfortable with github.
